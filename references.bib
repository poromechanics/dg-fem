  abstract = {We introduce a local adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method for convection-diffusion-reaction equations. The proposed method is based on a coarse grid and iteratively improves the solution's accuracy by solving local elliptic problems in refined subdomains. For purely diffusion problems, we already proved that this scheme converges under minimal regularity assumptions [A. Abdulle and G. Rosilho de Souza, ESAIM: M2AN, 53(4):1269\textendash 1303, 2019]. In this paper, we provide an algorithm for the automatic identification of the local elliptic problems' subdomains employing a flux reconstruction strategy. Reliable error estimators are derived for the local adaptive method. Numerical comparisons with a classical nonlocal adaptive algorithm illustrate the efficiency of the method.},

The method combines two key ideas which are at the basis of the finite volume and of the finite element method, the physics of wave propagation being accounted for by means of Riemann problems and accuracy being obtained by means of high-order polynomial approximations within elements. As a consequence the method is ideally suited to compute high-order accurate solution of the Navier\textendash Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by computing the compressible viscous flow on a flat plate and around a NACA0012 airfoil for several flow regimes using constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.},

We then rewrite this method solely in terms of the tangential fluid velocity and the pressure on mesh edges by means of a new hybridization technique. This novel formulation bypasses the difficult task of constructing an exactly divergence-free basis for velocity approximations. Moreover, the discrete system resulting from our method has fewer degrees of freedom than the original mixed method since the pressure and the tangential velocity variables are defined just on the mesh edges. Once these variables are computed, the velocity approximation satisfying the incompressibility condition exactly, as well as the continuous numerical approximation of the vorticity, can at once be obtained locally. Moreover, a discontinuous numerical approximation of the pressure within elements can also be obtained locally. We show how to compute the matrix system for our tangential velocity-pressure formulation on general meshes and present in full detail such computations for the lowest-order case of our method.},

  abstract = {We present a stable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with a perfectly matched layer (PML) for three and two space dimensional linear elastodynamics, in velocity-stress formulation, subject to well-posed linear boundary conditions. First, we consider the elastodynamics equation, in a cuboidal domain, and derive an unsplit PML truncating the domain using complex coordinate stretching. The hyperbolic structure of the underlying system enables the construction of continuous energy estimates, in the time domain for the elastic wave equation, and in the Laplace space for a sequence of PML model problems, with variations in one, two and three space dimensions, respectively. They correspond to PMLs normal to boundary faces, along edges and in corners. Second, we develop a DG numerical method for the linear elastodynamics equation using physically motivated numerical flux and penalty parameters, which are compatible with all well-posed, internal and external, boundary conditions. When the PML damping vanishes in all directions, by construction, our choice of penalty parameters yield an upwind scheme and a discrete energy estimate analogous to the continuous energy estimate. Third, to ensure numerical stability of the discretization when PML damping is present, it is necessary to extend the numerical DG fluxes, and the numerical inter-element and boundary procedures, to the PML auxiliary differential equations. This is crucial for deriving discrete energy estimates analogous to the continuous energy estimates. Numerical solutions are evolved in time using the high order arbitrary derivative (ADER) time stepping scheme of the same order of accuracy with the spatial discretization. By combining the DG spatial approximation with the high order ADER time stepping scheme and the accuracy of the PML we obtain an arbitrarily high-order accurate wave propagation solver in the time domain. Numerical experiments are presented in two and three space dimensions corroborating the theoretical results.},

The aim is to construct a non-oscillatory shock capturing DG method for the approximation of hyperbolic conservative laws without adding excessive numerical dispersion. Unlike some splitting techniques that are limited to linear approximations on rectangular grids, in this work, the solution is approximated by means of piecewise quadratic functions. The main idea of this new reconstructing and limiting technique follows a well-known approach where local maximum principle regions are defined by enforcing some constraints on the reconstruction of the solution. Numerical comparisons with some existing slope limiters on structured as well as on unstructured meshes show a superior accuracy of our proposed slope limiters.

When the pressure penalty parameter {$\gamma$} tends to 0 ({$\gamma>$}0), the velocity approximation tends to be H(div)-conforming and exactly divergence-free, and the velocity error bound tends to be pressure-robust. However, taking the value of {$\gamma$} too small will cause the over-stabilization of the pressure. Then, we can provide a post-processing procedure to obtain a stable pressure approximation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for Stokes flow. The method is devised by using the discontinuous Galerkin methodology to discretize a velocity-pressure-gradient formulation of the Stokes system with appropriate choices of the numerical fluxes and by applying a hybridization technique to the resulting discretization. One of the main features of this approach is that it reduces the globally coupled unknowns to the numerical trace of the velocity and the mean of the pressure on the element boundaries, thereby leading to a significant reduction in the size of the resulting matrix. Moreover, by using an augmented lagrangian method, the globally coupled unknowns are further reduced to the numerical trace of the velocity only. Another important feature is that the approximations of the velocity, pressure, and gradient converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L-2-norm, when polynomials of degree k {$>$}= 0 are used to represent the approximate variables. Based on the optimal convergence of the HDG method, we apply an element-by-element postprocessing scheme to obtain a new approximate velocity, which converges with order k + 2 in the L-2-norm for k {$>$}= 1. The postprocessing performed at the element level is less expensive than the solution procedure. Numerical results are provided to assess the performance of the method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A cut-off operator is introduced in the discontinuous Galerkin schemes to treat the coupling of flow and transport and the coupling of transport and reaction. The uniform positive definitiveness and the uniform Lipschitz continuity are established for the commonly used dispersion\textendash diffusion tensor. Interestingly, the polynomial degrees of approximation for the flow and the transport equations need to be in the same order in order to maintain the convergence of DG applied to the coupled system. Optimal or nearly optimal convergences for both flow and transport are obtained when the same polynomial degrees of approximation are chosen for flow and transport. That is, error estimate in L2(H1) for concentration is optimal in h and nearly optimal in p with a loss of 12; error estimates in semi-L{$\infty$}(H1) for pressure and in L{$\infty$}(L2) for velocity establish optimality in h and sub-optimality in p by 12; error estimates for concentration jump and pressure jump are optimal in both h and p.},
